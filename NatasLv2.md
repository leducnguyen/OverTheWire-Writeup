# LV2 #
When I get access on the Lv2 Natas challenge, I get a message:

While watching the source page of this page, I found a strange link
<img width="1399" height="381" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79eb3704-07f6-4aea-9635-8fcd694adbda" />
in "**src**", there is a link to the image throughout the "**files**", so I paste "**/files**" in the URL of the website

Well, it has a file name "**users.txt**", so I click on that text file

The password for the next level has appeared!
