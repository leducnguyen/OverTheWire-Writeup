🔐 **Level 1**

After accessing the server, we use the `ls` command 📂 to see the available files:

Here we find a file named **`-`**. Normally, running `cat -` would be interpreted as an **option** instead of a filename ⚠️.  
👉 To handle this, we prefix it with `./` so the system knows it’s a file, not an option.  

```bash
cat ./-
This reveals the hidden password 🔑:
