# LV9 âš¡ Command Injection  

When accessing the webpage, I saw a **small message** along with an **input field**:

ðŸ‘‰ After entering a random input, the page returned a list of strings containing the entered character.  
This behavior suggested a possible **Command Injection** vulnerability:

ðŸ”Ž I also noticed the text **"view src code"** in the bottom-right corner, so I clicked on it and discovered that the challenge uses the PHP function **`passthru`**, which executes **Linux system commands**:

To exploit this, I injected the following payload to terminate the current command and execute **cat** on the password file:  

test; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10
Simply put, the above command is substituted directly into the place where the key is attached to the previous passthru command.

âœ¨ And the **password appeared** ðŸ”‘:
