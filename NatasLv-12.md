# LV12 ðŸ“¤ File Upload Exploit  

When accessing the challenge, the page displayed a **title** along with two buttons:  
**"choose file"** and **"upload file"**.

ðŸ‘‰ Clicking **View Source Code**, I found the backend logic of the webpage:

From the code, it was clear that the site allows **file uploads**, with a size restriction of **â‰¤ 1KB**.

## ðŸ”Ž Exploitation  

1. **Test uploading a `.php` file**  
   <img width="1920" height="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304bb1d1-2f23-4634-8ba3-2e1d9541385f" />  

   Using Burp Suite to intercept the request:  
   <img width="1485" height="534" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca4da5a-4063-4450-b0a1-2e30ea1243cf" />  

   The file was uploaded, but the server renamed it with a **`.jpg`** extension.

2. **Bypass by uploading PHP code**  
   I modified the file contents to:  

   ```php
   <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
Then uploaded it again.

Remote command execution
After upload, I navigated to the uploaded file and appended a command parameter:

upload/nguyen.php?cmd=cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13


This executed the cat command on the hidden password file.

âœ¨ Result

The password for Natas13 appeared:
