I clicked **View Source Code** to check the `index.html`:

To test for SQL Injection, I entered the following payload in the **username** field and any value in the **password** field:  
`" OR 1=1 -- a l`

The condition **`OR 1=1`** always evaluates to **true**, and `--` comments out the rest of the query, effectively bypassing authentication. As a result, the page returned the success message containing the key.  

The password for **Natas15** is:
